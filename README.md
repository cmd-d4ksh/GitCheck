# GitCheck 🔍

A smart trust and reliability scoring system that helps you evaluate open-source projects before you use them. 

GitCheck uses machine learning to analyze contribution patterns and maintenance history, giving you confidence in the projects you depend on.

## Overview

Finding a reliable open-source library can be tricky. Is this project actively maintained? Can I trust it for my production environment? GitCheck answers these questions by analyzing real GitHub data and giving you a trust score.

Whether you're a developer selecting dependencies or a team lead vetting projects, GitCheck provides the insights you need to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Smart Analysis**: Evaluates projects based on contribution frequency, issue resolution, and maintenance patterns
- **Trust Scoring**: Get an easy-to-understand reliability score for any repository
- **ML-Powered**: Uses machine learning to identify patterns that indicate project health
- **Real-Time Data**: Analyzes actual GitHub metrics and activity

## Quick Start

Get started with GitCheck in just a few steps...

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main application:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

## How It Works

GitCheck evaluates repositories by analyzing:
- **Contribution Patterns**: How frequently contributors commit and engage
- **Maintenance Activity**: Recent updates and issue resolution rates  
- **Project Sustainability**: Long-term activity trends and project maturity

The ML model learns from these patterns to predict the trustworthiness of repositories.
